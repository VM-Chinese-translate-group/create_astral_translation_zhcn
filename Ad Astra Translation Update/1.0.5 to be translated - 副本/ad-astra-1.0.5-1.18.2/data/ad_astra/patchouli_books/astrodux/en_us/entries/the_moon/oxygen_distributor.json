To check that oxygen is being distributed, click \"show\" in the distributor GUI. If you see bubbles floating around, that means that the room is being supplied with oxygen."

Patch the hole to avoid unnecessary power draw and oxygen usage. After that, you should be able to take off your oxygen suit and survive. Each oxygen distributor can support up to 2,000 blocks, allowing you to build a moderately sized space station or base. If you need more, you can place more oxygen distributors."
